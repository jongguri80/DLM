# DLM
Distributed Lag Model (DLM) to examine associations between the built environment and health.

###### We assume that the user has to have already calculated DL covariate matrix and distance lag

set.seed(10)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

### Generate locations of outcome and locations of environmental factors (e.g., convenience stores) ##
n_X = 3000;n_Y = 1000

pts_X = cbind(runif(n_X, -25, 75), runif(n_X, -25, 75)) ## 3000 locations of environmental factors ##
pts_Y = cbind(runif(n_Y, -25, 75), runif(n_Y, -25, 75)) ## 1000 locations of outcome ##
colnames(pts_X) = colnames(pts_Y) = c("x", "y") 
head(pts_Y)
head(pts_X)

### Black dots are locations of environmental factors and red dots are locations of outcome ##
plot(pts_X, cex=.5, pch=20)
points(pts_Y, col="red", cex = .5, pch=20)

### A vector of distance lag ###
Lag = seq(from=0.1, to=10, length=100)

### Generate DL covariates ###
X = DL_X(pts_Y, pts_X, Lag)

### Generate individual factors, e.g., gender and age ###
Gender = rbinom(n_Y, 1, 0.5)
Age = rpois(n_Y, 65)

### True DL coefficients assuming a normal kernel function ###
true_DL_coeff = 0.1*dnorm(Lag, sd=5/3)/dnorm(0, sd=5/3)
plot(Lag, true_DL_coeff, type="l", ylab = "DL coefficients", main="True DL coefficient over distance")

### True variance of residual errors ###
true_tau_sq = 1

### Generate residuals ####
e = rnorm(n_Y, 0, sd=sqrt(true_tau_sq))

### Generate true outcome Y, using a below true function ###
Y = 0.5*Gender -0.5*Age + X %*% true_DL_coeff + e

### Realign a covariate matrix for other fixed effects ###
Z = model.matrix( ~ Gender + Age)   

### Fit a DLM in Frequentist framework ###
fm1 = dlm(Y, X, Z, Lag)

### Fit DLM in Bayesian framework ###
